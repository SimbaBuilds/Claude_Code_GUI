Browser based.  let's go Bun. 

Please design this for me.  Key features:
- Chat first UI.  I want to be able to see multiple chat UIs each representing a terminal running CLaude Code.
- Support all slash commands that are in the native app.
- No file explorer - I can go in the IDE for that.
- Another LLM agent built on the Claude Agents SDK, that can oversee and view these terminals, run sleep commands, etc...

Any calrifying questions?
