Trying to decide on a few changes.  Thoughts?


- [ ]  Overseer changes
    - [ ]  Need an indicator that shows any terminals that the overseer has open
        - [ ]  Or make sure any terminals opened by the overseer are also shown in the main GUI
    - [ ]  do the overseer’s claude sessions get killed when the bun server is killed?
    - [ ]  clear chat functionality
    - [ ]  Generally need more robust UX for using the overseer
    - [ ]  Have it take over an existing cc session from IDE
        - [ ]  Or make sure it always has access to all local claude sessions whether initiated in GUI or not


1. Please verify with Playwright MCP
2. Agree
3. Agree
4. Agree
5. Ok, so the overseer can only see processes that it started or any process started in the GUI?
6. resuming sessions in the GUI or remotely via the SLack integration is completely fine and makes sense
